I don't really like to make resolutions for the new year because I am terrible at following through on them. I do think that this year, I need to focus on me a bit more. Work on exercising, work on finding a hobby or two, and not make everything about content creation. 

### Tired

I'm so tired. My yearly seasonal depression has severely impacted my ability to function, and I'm planning on reworking my current medication setup. 

### Speaking

I like [Todd Libby's](https://toddl.dev/) idea for doing max 1 conference per month. I already have some speaking engagements planned for 2023, but I will probably be creating less new content for these conferences.

### Streaming

I think i'm going to stream once a week. Maybe less. I've been very kind of scatter shot about the content I'm making and I don't know that I will have the energy to curate the things I'm actually going to work on.

### Outside

I need to go outside more. 3 out of 4 doctors agree. The one that doesn't agree is my dermatologist. So, just make sure I have suscreen.

### Conclusion

It's not all doom and gloom. The future holds possibility, and I need to get my own stuff in order so I can get back to doing stuff I enjoy. Hope y'all all have a good new year!
