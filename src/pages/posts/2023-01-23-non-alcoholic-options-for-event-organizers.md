Todd Libby recently wrote about the need for conference organizers to support those of us who don't want to drink. As someone who has been sober for 13+ years now, I agree whole heartedly with this sentiment. Sometimes it is difficult for people who don't regularly think about this to know how to have actionable ways of changing things though. So, I'm going to give you some tips. You're welcome.

## 1 - Alcohol is not the focus

If your event centers around alcohol, you've already failed. I cannot save you if you decide a “KEG STAND AND BEER PONG/FLIP CUP COMPETITION” is an appropriate thing to have at a professional event. In fact, I might suggest you look into getting help. Anytime you make an event that focuses on drinking as the primary activity, you have excluded the following people:

- Recovering alcoholics (Hi.)
- People who take medication that doesn't allow them to drink
- People who are pregnant
- Anyone under the age of 21 (This is more of USA thing, but generally, still a thing.)
- Anyone who doesn't feel safe being around people drinking

If you are hell bent on making an event focused on drinking, please go ahead and print up that list and add it to your flyers to declare that you are fine discriminating against those people.

### What to do instead: Activities

Instead of drinking being the activity, make drinking be a thing next to the activity. Here are a list of potential ideas:

- Team trivia
- Karaoke
- Bowling
- Board game night
- Chess Competition
- Food Truck Rally
- Dinner

There can be drinking. That's fine! Just don't make it the focus.

## 2 - Provide Non-Alcoholic Options

This is the big one. As someone who doesn't drink it is a bit of a slap in the face when I go to an event and my options are:

- Water
- Bottled Water
- Unsweetened Ice Tea

Let's be honest. You're here probably because you're wondering why I am complaining. That's totally enough options! Nope. No it isn't. This is the equivalent of showing up to a wine tasting to discover you will only be trying out a walmart brand pinot. This is like going to a brewery and only being able to order Natty Light. It's like going to a whiskey tasting and being offered jack and coke. IT IS OFFENSIVE.

### What to do instead: Options

People love options. Minimum, you should be offering sodas. But here's the thing (which you may not know) many local brewers near you make non alcoholic offerings.
