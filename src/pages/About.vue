      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Alex Riviere. I'm a web developer from Atlanta, GA that specializes in Vue.js, python, and PHP.
        I also help co-organize the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Vue-js-Meetup/">Atlanta Vue.js Meetup</a> and the
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/python-atlanta/">PyATL Meetup</a> since March of 2019. This is my personal blog
        and playground. Hopefully, something here will be helpful to you.</p>
