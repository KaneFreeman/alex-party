title: JavaScript Labels and returning early
date: 2021-04-02T13:00:00.000Z
excerpt: Brendan Eich recently tweeted about labels in JavaScript. I decided to
  play with it.

I have previously experimented with labels on for loops and after seeing the tweet in question I decided to experiment on if statements as well. I threw together a little demo Codepen and thought about why we don't use this style of syntax.



In a way, JavaScript labels are a call back to BASIC programming and the GOTO command.
