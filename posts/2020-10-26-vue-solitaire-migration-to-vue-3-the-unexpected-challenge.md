excerpt: I upgraded an app to Vue 3 and I learned some things about it.
---
I've just finished upgrading [vue-solitaire](https://vue-solitaire.netlify.app) to use Vue 3. There are 3 main things I learned in this process that I wanted to let you (dear reader) know about. First, the way you add global components has changed a little. Next, the way apps mount has both syntactically changed, as well as how it ends up in the DOM has changed. Finally, Vue 3 has a new way of code-splitting and loading components asynchronously.
