Look, let's be honest. You aren't really here for some earth shattering information. You saw a very clickbaity title that I made to troll [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co) and quite honestly, I don't think she was ACTUALLY expecting this.

As long as you are here though, I should write up some interesting links that I've found over the past few days that caught my attention.

### [Building The SSG Iâ€™ve Always Wanted: An 11ty, Vite And JAM Sandwich](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/building-ssg-11ty-vite-jam-sandwich/)

Ben Holmes has an amazing write up of his time over the last almost 2 years of his adventures in making his own static site generator setup. It's a great read, and honestly is so much fun.

### Netflix Can do Better

The story of the week in my news feed is surrounding Netflix and the new Dave Chappelle special. I have even had a very long phone call with a friend about this. Rather than attempt to pontificate, I'll link to the 2 articles I have read from the people who are living this story:

* [Terra Field - "It Was Never About Dave"](https://rainofterra.com/it-was-never-about-dave-9aee8b765978)
* [NYT - "Netflix workers plan a walkout as the fallout over Dave Chappelle continues."](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/business/media/netflix-dave-chappelle-employee-walkout.html)

I have yet to watch the Chappelle special, but I will be so that I can speak from an informed place about it.

### [Alpha Paintlet](https://daverupert.com/2021/10/alpha-paintlet/)

Dave Rupert talks about using houdini to make custom CSS properties with more magic. I love new web technology and the unlimited terrible things you can do with it.

And that's all. There, Cassidy. I wrote something. Your move.
