Thoughts on moving to a new system.

I am currently moving [alex.party](https://alex.party) over to the netlify name servers. Soon this will be the new home of my blog! Maybe I can also get some of my other old domains pointing here too.

Anyway, I wanted to make a system that was more maintainable than the old system. The old system was an early attempt at making a blog in vue and I will likely salvage what I can from it. This is backed by the [netlifycms](https://netlifycms.org) which is ridiculously handy for building static sites.

Another thing i am going to hopefully implement is an actual RSS feed for this blog. I just need to get gridsome set up with that.

Alright, I'm going to finish my coffee and greet the new day.
